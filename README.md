# Resume-Matcher

Resume Matcher is a web-based application that evaluates resumes against job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It simulates how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screen candidates by calculating a match percentage and identifying missing or relevant skills.

The application supports resume uploads in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to measure alignment between resumes and job descriptions, while extracting key technical skills to perform skill gap analysis. Results are displayed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard for clear and actionable insights.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of NLP, information retrieval, and full-stack development concepts, making it suitable for academic projects, hackathons, and software engineering portfolios.
